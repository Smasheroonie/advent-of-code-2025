# Advent of Code 2025
My code for this year's AoC!

## Day 1:
I'm new to Python which added a bit of challenge. I managed to find the solution to both parts in about 2 hours.

## Day 2:
This took me about 4 hours. Quite challenging! There are definitely more efficient ways to handle this, but I'm learning more about using Python.
