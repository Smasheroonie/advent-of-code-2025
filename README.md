# Advent of Code 2025
My code for this year's AoC!

## Day 1:
I'm new to Python which added a bit of challenge. I managed to find the solution to both parts in about 2 hours.

## Day 2:
This took me about 4 hours. Quite challenging! There are definitely more efficient ways to handle this, but I'm learning more about using Python.

## Day 3:
Part 1 was easy enough today, but part 2 proved too challenging to complete before I ran out of time for the day. I identified a possibility of a recursive solution early on but could not execute it correctly. In the end I found an answer from another person to help me understand, and adapted an answer from there.
